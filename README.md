Creating an application to manage hospital patients involves a systematic approach, starting with defining both functional and non-functional requirements. The functional requirements include features such as patient registration, allowing healthcare staff to enter personal details and medical histories; patient management, which enables users to view, update, and delete records; and appointment scheduling for facilitating and managing patient appointments. Additionally, the application must handle electronic medical records (EMRs) securely, manage billing processes, and provide reporting capabilities for analyzing patient demographics and treatment outcomes. On the non-functional side, the system should ensure performance by responding to user actions within two seconds and accommodate concurrent access from multiple users. Security is paramount, requiring patient data protection through encryption and strict access controls to comply with regulations like HIPAA. The user interface should be intuitive for users of varying technical expertise, and the application must be scalable to handle increasing patient and staff numbers without degrading performance. Furthermore, it should guarantee 99.9% availability, allowing continuous access to patient information. Diagrams will play a crucial role in this development process, including a use case diagram to illustrate interactions between users and the system, a context diagram to define system boundaries, a class diagram to outline main entities like Patient and Appointment, a sequence diagram to depict the flow of events in patient registration, and a database schema to define the structure of the database with tables for Patients, Appointments, MedicalRecords, and Billing. Once the requirements and diagrams are established, the development will commence in Java, utilizing robust libraries and frameworks such as Spring Boot for the backend, Hibernate for ORM, and JavaFX or Swing for the frontend. This modular and maintainable application will ultimately serve as a vital tool for healthcare providers, improving patient care through efficient management and access to essential medical information.
